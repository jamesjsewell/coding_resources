                    <strong>Objects</strong>
                    <li>An object is the core unit of OOP. Objects are uniquely named and represent an instance of a class. Each object houses different states (attributes), and shared behaviors, called methods. For example, a Prius is an object in the class of “cars,” in a subclass of “hybrid cars.” Its attributes include anything from the number of doors it has to how its electric component is charged. It’s similar to other cars by its behavior—it drives—but its attributes are what set it apart.</li> 
                    Classes: A class is a blueprint for how an object is built, as well as being a sort of “parent category” for objects. Using the previous example, a class dictates the concept of a car—four wheels, an engine, a body, brakes, etc. It allows certain set criteria to be passed down to all objects in the class. All varieties of cars behave relatively the same on a basic level, but its their attributes and methods that make them unique.
                    Inheritance: This is an important aspect of OOP, hinted at above. By deriving classes from parent classes, behaviors can be passed down to objects, then more complicated attributes can be added the deeper you go. For example, breaking a car into subclasses (car → sports car → V8 sports car) makes it possible to layer in more features without starting from scratch.
                    Abstraction & Encapsulation: This describes how attributes are housed and hidden within an object—including its data. Objects are designed to only reveal the necessary data, allowing software to interact with the object on a higher level. It’s equal parts security and simplicity. In the case of car parts, by safely stowing them within the body of an assembled car, things are less likely to get broken, and users can interact with the big picture: pressing the gas means go, no questions asked.

                <h3>A small polished app is better than a complex mess</h3>
              
                <p>
                    I would work on things that i could see myself working on for the next 2 years. Making the personal projects I create matter to me is important. If my projects don't matter to me, it will show and they won't matter to others. To achieve creating work that i am excited about, it is essential to not let expectations and perfectionism get in the way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I would think of the project in versions.
                    The first version I create is the prototype
                    The next version is the minimum viable product or “mvp”, then “alpha”, “beta”, and so on.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    What constitutes a “version” does each new change make the app a new version?
                    No, I think of each version as its own complete app. I’ll know that the version is complete when it functions. That way when someone gives me feedback I can save it for a later version.
                    
                    Why bother doing things this way? Well as I am just starting out it is best that I present projects that I am proud of and am not stressing over. This will make me more confident and excited about presenting and talking about my work.
                
                </p>
                <p>
                    How do I keep track of versions? Being proficient with GitHub or something similar is great, this will be the optimal way to approach it. If I were beginning to learn GitHub and weren’t yet proficient with it, I would use Google drive or some kind of storage system to store the versions of my app.
                    
                    Make each version “good enough”. By good enough I mean I have to lower my expectations of the scope of the project and always keep in mind that a new feature can be introduced in later versions. I would do my best to first of all make the simple app work. Then work on making the version presentable.
